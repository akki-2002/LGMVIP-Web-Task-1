# LGMVIP-Web-Task-1
We can include our task list and indicate whether a task is complete or not in our to-do list. The new task will be added to the list after we enter it in the input field and click the "Add" button. To designate a task as finished or unfinished, click on its name. To remove the particular job from the To-Do list, we will add a close icon.
